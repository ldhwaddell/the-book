- Cargo is the build system and package manager
- use `cargo new <project_name>` to create new project. 
- packages of code are called crates
- `cargo.lock` keeps track of exact versions of dependencies on the project
- `cargo run` builds and runs in one step
- `cargo check` checks if code compiles but doesn't produce executable
- `cargo build --release` builds an optimized release version
